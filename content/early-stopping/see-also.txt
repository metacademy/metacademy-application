* Other strategies for controlling overfitting in feed-forward neural nets include:
** Weight decay, a form of $L_2$ regularization [weight-decay]
** Tikhonov regularization, which rewards invariance to noise in the inputs [tikhonov-regularization]
** Tangent propagation, which rewards invariance to irrelevant transformations of the inputs such as translation and scalling [tangent-propagation]
** Generative pre-training, which improves generalization by encouraging solutions which also reflect the data distribution [generative-pre-training]
